                However, as the years progressed, Steam transitioned into becoming a platform that sold video games and held all the games in a digital library.
                After that, Valve introduced Steam Workshop which allowed for users and developers to modify the game.  In 2015, Steam added an online streaming system where a user can stream his or her gameplay to anyone.
                Overall, Steam evolved into a very convenient and massive gaming platform that is popular.  It controls about 70% of the $4 billion market for downloaded PC games. </p>
