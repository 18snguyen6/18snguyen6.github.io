    <p>The purpose of The Arena is to survive as long as possible and to score as many points as possible by killing the challengers.  The process of developing this game was through trial and error.
    By testing the game, we were able to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it.  This process was used a lot for the idle animation and movement animation of the player.
    We had trouble trying to get the animation to stop at the moment another animation started.  This problem caused another animation to occur which we did not want.  To fix this, we made a broadcast system where when
    one of the directional movement keys were pressed, it would stop all scripts, broadcast all messages that started the player.  This was the fix for the movement, but we were not able to figure out how to do this for the idle animation.

        <h3>The Temple of Tezcatlipoca Interactive Fiction by Sean Nguyen and Michael Vu</h3>

      <p>In our interactive fiction The Temple of Tezcatlipoca, you play as a professional bounty hunter that was assigned to retrieve the mask of Tezcatlipoca.  You navigate in Tezcatlipoca's temple, encountering traps and choosing the
      path that you should take.  To code our story, we decided to create functions that were the decision points in the fiction.  So, whenever the player typed in a response to a decision, the next function would be called upon and the action would
      be repeated.  While we were working on this, we didn't come across any major problems other than forgetting to close our lines properly like a close parenthesis after " print('' ".  The parts I liked about the interactive fiction was organizing
      every decision point with functions which made the coding easy and clean.  Coming up with the story was rough for us since we had too many ideas.  A story I particularly liked was "Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!" because the story was very 
      comedic and played very well.  If I had another chance to do an interactive fiction over again, I would continue making decision points with functions and add more details to the story.
