    <h1>The Life of Gabe Logan Newell</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>1962</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Birth of Gabe Logan Newell</h3>
                <p>Gabe was born on November 3, 1962 in Seattle, Washington.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>1980s</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>University Education</h3>
                <p>Gaben attended Harvard University for three years before dropping out to go work for Microsoft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Microsoft Producer</h3>
                <p>Gaben then spent the next 13 years working at Microsoft as a producer for the Windows 1.01, 1.02, and 1.03 OS.
                He mentions that learned more from 3 months at Microsoft than his entire time at Harvard.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>1990s</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Inspirations for the Gaming Industry</h3>
                <p>Gaben's first experience with video games was Star Trek on the Burroughs mainframe.  
                Later, Gaben saw Doom and realized that video games would be the future of entertainment.  
                Lastly, Mario 64, Gaben's favorite game of all time, made him see video games as a form of art.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>1996: Birth of Valve Corporation</h3>
                <p>After his experiences with the previous games, Gaben left Microsoft and founded Valve Corporation.
                Gaben's first contribution would be his expansion to PC gaming with hits such as Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Team Fortress.
                Gaben saw that the PC was a better platform for gaming than the NES or Sega systems.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2000s</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Steam</h3>
                <p>Gaben's next contribution would be the release of Steam in 2003.  Steam's original purpose was to automate the update process of Valve games.
                However, as the years progressed, Steam transitioned into becoming a platform that sold video games and held all the games in a digital library.
                After that, Valve introduced Steam Workshop which allowed for users and developers to modify the game.  In 2015, Steam added an online streaming system where a user can stream his or her gameplay to anyone.
                Overall, Steam evolved into a very convenient and massive gaming platform that is popular.  It controls about 70% of the $4 billion market for downloaded PC games. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fuchs' Dystrophy</h3>
                <p>Gaben suffered from Fuch's dystrophy, a disease which affects the cornea.  However, Gaben had done two cornea transplants in 2006 and 2007 which had cured him and changed him completely.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Present</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Gaben</h3>
                <p>Gaben has become a popular figure within the PC gaming community.  He is most famously known for his Steam sales and is commonly referred to as "Lord Gaben."
                These sales appear very often </p>
